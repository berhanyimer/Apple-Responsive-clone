Responsive Design
****************
This project is fully responsive and uses media queries along with Bootstrap's grid system to ensure that the website adapts perfectly across different devices. Below are the breakpoints used for responsiveness:

Desktop: 1200px and above
Tablet: 768px - 1199px
Mobile: 767px and below
Special care was taken to ensure that the layout, typography, and images adjust smoothly based on screen size, and the navigation collapses into a mobile-friendly hamburger menu for smaller screens.
